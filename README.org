#+description: README file for the 'calc' program.

This is a small bash shell script that provides a simple command line
calculator.

Below is the formal documentation (and usage message) for the =calc= script.
See the corresponding [[https://blog0.steelcandy.org/2021-11-02-calculating-on-the-command-line.html][blog post]] for a more informal and expansive
introduction to the program.

=usage: calc expr=

where 'expr' is the expression whose value is to be calculated.
(It can consist of one or more words.)

In the result, the number of decimal digits after the decimal
point is given by the the 'sc' environment variable if it's
defined, or the 'CALC_SCALE' environment variable if it's
defined: otherwise it defaults to 2. So for example, both of
the commands

#+begin_example
sc=8 = 355 / 113
CALC_SCALE=8 = 355 / 113
#+end_example

output 3.14159292 instead of just 3.14.
